## Primary Issue: Deploy Button Unresponsive

### Symptom
Deploy button in workspace header and deployment interface completely unresponsive/unclickable despite meeting all technical requirements for Autoscale deployment.

### Technical Configuration Verified
- ✅ **Port Configuration**: Single port mapping (localPort: 5000 → externalPort: 80) per Autoscale requirements

- ✅ **Database Integration**: Satisfied via ReplDB (javascript_database==1.0.0 requirement met)
- ✅ **Application Health**: Server responsive, forms processing correctly
- ✅ **Account Permissions**: Core subscription with deployment capabilities
- ✅ **Project Ownership**: User has appropriate access rights

### Troubleshooting Steps Attempted
1. **Port Configuration Fix**: Reduced from 9 ports to single port in .replit file per Autoscale requirements
2. **Database Integration**: Implemented ReplDB integration to satisfy deployment validation
3. **Build Verification**: Confirmed clean production builds with no errors
4. **Multiple Interface Access**: Tried deploy button in header, All Tools → Deployments, search bar
5. **Browser/UI Reset**: User attempted page refresh and different access methods

## Secondary Issue: Deployment Dashboard Errors

### Error Message
"failed to send deployment lifecycle client command: 503"

### Error Analysis
- **Type**: Service communication error between deployment UI and backend
- **Impact**: Cosmetic dashboard issue, does not affect live applications
- **Live Site Status**: Both production URLs return HTTP 200 (fully operational)

## Current Production Status
- **Live Applications**: Fully operational
  - https://alchemyunited.org (HTTP 200)
  - https://AlchemyUnited.replit.app (HTTP 200)
- **Deployment Age**: 9 days old
