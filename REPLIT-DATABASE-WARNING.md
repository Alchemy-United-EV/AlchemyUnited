# NEON API ENDPOINT REACTIVATION GUIDE

## Current Issue
"Failed to check for database diff: The endpoint has been disabled. Enable it using Neon API and retry."

## Investigation Status
The warning persists despite ReplDB integration satisfying deployment requirements. This suggests the warning is cosmetic for deployment but may indicate an actual Neon database management issue.

## Options to Enable Neon Endpoint

### Option 1: Neon Console (Recommended)
1. Go to https://console.neon.tech/
2. Find your project: `ep-fragrant-block-ae5p9ni0`
3. Navigate to Settings → General
4. Look for "Suspend compute" or "Auto-suspend" settings
5. Disable auto-suspend or increase idle timeout

### Option 2: Neon API Method
If you have Neon API access:
```bash
# Get project status
curl -X GET https://console.neon.tech/api/v2/projects/YOUR_PROJECT_ID \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_NEON_API_KEY"

# Enable endpoint
curl -X PATCH https://console.neon.tech/api/v2/projects/YOUR_PROJECT_ID/endpoints/YOUR_ENDPOINT_ID \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_NEON_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"disabled": false}'
```

### Option 3: Contact Neon Support
If the above don't work, contact Neon support with:
- Project ID: `ep-fragrant-block-ae5p9ni0-pooler`
- Database: `neondb`
- Issue: Endpoint disabled, need reactivation

## Current Deployment Status
✅ **Your app is still deployment-ready** - ReplDB integration satisfies Replit's requirements
✅ **Forms work correctly** - Email-only storage functioning
✅ **No deployment blocker** - This is now a database management issue, not deployment issue
