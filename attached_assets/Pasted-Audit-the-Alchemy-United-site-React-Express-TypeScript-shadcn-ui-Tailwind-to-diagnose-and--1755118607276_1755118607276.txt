Audit the Alchemy United site (React + Express + TypeScript + shadcn/ui + Tailwind) to diagnose and fix loss of visual energy after recent security/structure changes. Check: (1) Brand & Theme – Tailwind theme tokens, shadcn/ui theme, color contrast, gold accents, gradients, shadows, glass/blur, and brand imagery; verify no fallback to neutral grays, and that HSL variables aren’t overridden. (2) Typography & Hierarchy – font pairing, size scale, weight/letter‑spacing, heading hierarchy, line‑length/leading; ensure CTAs are visually dominant and not flattened. (3) Motion & Micro‑interactions – GSAP/Lottie/Framer hooks, reduced‑motion handling, hover/press states, focus rings, button/CTA animations, scroll‑trigger reveals; confirm nothing was disabled by SSR, hydration, or prefers-reduced-motion overreach. (4) Layout & Density – container widths (max-w), spacing rhythm, card density, empty states, iconography; restore depth with layered backgrounds and elevation tokens (shadows, borders). (5) Hero & Media – hero art/video autoplay policy, poster frames, compression, loading strategy; ensure first paint isn’t text‑only. (6) Forms & Dashboard – visual polish on inputs, statuses, badges, and tables; retain clarity but bring back affordances (subtle shadows, row hover, status color coding). Keep no hard‑coded mock data; all changes env‑driven.

Deliver:
• A before/after visual diff (screens at 360/768/1280) and a Dullness Score (1–10) with rationale.
• A target style spec (tokens for color, shadow, radius, blur, spacing, motion durations/easings) and a 10‑minute visual energy pass (smallest diffs) that lifts the score ≥2 points.
• Patch files with minimal diffs: theme tokens (tailwind.config.ts, globals.css/theme.css), shadcn/ui overrides, hero/media component, motion hooks.
• Verify no regressions: a11y contrast ≥ WCAG AA, Core Web Vitals unaffected, reduced‑motion respected, emails unaffected, no mock data introduced.
• Output a short checklist PASS/FAIL with exact file paths/lines and a git diff block for each fix.
