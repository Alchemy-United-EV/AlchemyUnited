Goal: Implement the previously recommended short-term items to improve page speed, maintainability, and trust. Use a new branch cleanup/short-term-ev-site. Produce before/after metrics.

Tasks
	1.	Convert heavy images to WebP + optimize
	‚Ä¢	Locate all JPG/PNG >120KB in /public/assets/.
	‚Ä¢	Create /public/assets/webp/ and generate WebP versions at 75‚Äì80 quality; keep originals.
	‚Ä¢	Update imports/src to prefer WebP with JPG/PNG fallback (<picture> or simple webp then img fallback).
	‚Ä¢	Output a table of each optimized asset: old size ‚Üí new size.
	2.	Progressive image loading
	‚Ä¢	Add loading="lazy" to non-hero images.
	‚Ä¢	For the hero, add a tiny blurred placeholder (data URI or 20px WebP) swapped once loaded.
	‚Ä¢	Verify no layout shift (CLS) by setting explicit width/height or aspect ratio.
	3.	Prune unused UI components
	‚Ä¢	Scan client/src/components/ui/ and list components with 0 imports.
	‚Ä¢	Move them to client/_archive/components/ (no deletions).
	‚Ä¢	Rebuild and report bundle delta.
	4.	Split stable-home.tsx into modules
	‚Ä¢	Create client/src/pages/home/ and extract:
	‚Ä¢	Hero.tsx, Features.tsx, CTA.tsx, FooterCTA.tsx
	‚Ä¢	Replace the large file with a composed Home.tsx that imports these.
	‚Ä¢	No visual/messaging changes. Just structure.
	‚Ä¢	Verify routes unchanged.
	5.	Add LocalBusiness schema.org
	‚Ä¢	Inject JSON-LD in <head> via a small component SeoLocalBusiness.tsx.
	‚Ä¢	Include: name, logo, url, sameAs (empty array ok), address (placeholder ok), openingHours (basic).
	‚Ä¢	Wire it only on / for now.

Verification
	‚Ä¢	npm run build passes.
	‚Ä¢	Report Core Web Vitals proxies: build size, largest image size, number of JS chunks, and approximate LCP image bytes before/after.
	‚Ä¢	Visual spot check: hero, features, and CTAs render identically.
	‚Ä¢	No 404s from asset path changes.

Deliverables
	‚Ä¢	üìä Table: image optimizations (file, old ‚Üí new KB, % saved).
	‚Ä¢	üßπ List of archived components.
	‚Ä¢	üì¶ Bundle before/after (KB) and page count unchanged.
	‚Ä¢	üìù Commit message:
chore(speed): webp + lazy images, prune unused ui, modularize Home, add LocalBusiness schema

Constraints
	‚Ä¢	Keep all originals archived or kept alongside WebP.
	‚Ä¢	If any step risks breaking visuals, stop and report exact file/line.
