Objective: Fix SPA navigation that leads to blank pages when clicking “Get Early Access” and “Become a Host”.
Hard constraints (do not violate):
	1.	Do not create or rename any files or folders.
	2.	Do not install or remove packages.
	3.	Make the smallest possible edits; show each diff before applying.
	4.	If a change is risky, ask first.
	5.	Keep dev and prod behavior separate (Vite handles routing in dev; server fallback only in prod).

Diagnosis plan (execute in order, show findings in the chat):
	1.	Reproduce: run in dev, click both CTAs. Capture browser console errors and the Network panel result for the click (document vs XHR).
	2.	Open these files and confirm implementations:
	•	client/src/main.tsx (or index.tsx) – verify <Router> from wouter wraps the app and that <Route> entries exist for /, /early-access, /host-application, /thank-you.
	•	client/src/pages/home/Hero.tsx and client/src/components/CTA-Tracker.tsx – CTAs must use client-side navigation via useLocation() from wouter (setLocation('/path')) or <Link href="/path">. No window.location full reloads.
	•	client/src/pages/early-access.tsx, host-application.tsx, thank-you.tsx – confirm each exports default component that returns JSX (not null) and renders without runtime errors.
	3.	Server config: server/routes.ts – ensure the “catch-all send index.html” only runs in production. In dev, don’t intercept—Vite must handle routes.
	4.	Quick programmatic checks (no new deps):
	•	Insert temporary console.log('[route] early-access') etc. at the top of each page component; open DevTools console and click CTAs to confirm the pages actually render. Remove logs after verifying.
	5.	If misconfigurations are found, propose the small diff(s) from the snippets below, show the before/after, then apply.

Success criteria (stop when all pass and report):
	•	Clicking Get Early Access and Become a Host does not full-reload and renders the correct page (no blank screen).
	•	Submitting both forms fetch()es the correct API and navigates to /thank-you on 2xx.
	•	Dev: no server SPA fallback intercepting routes. Prod: catch-all fallback serving client/dist/index.html.
	•	No new files, no new packages, no unrelated edits. Provide the final list of lines changed.
