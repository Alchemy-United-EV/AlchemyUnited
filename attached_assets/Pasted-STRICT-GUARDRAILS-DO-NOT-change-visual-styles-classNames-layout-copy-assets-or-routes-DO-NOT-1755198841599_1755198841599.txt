STRICT GUARDRAILS. DO NOT change visual styles, classNames, layout, copy, assets, or routes. 
DO NOT add new pages/components. DO NOT upgrade packages unless explicitly listed below.

Objective: Freeze current UI and protect it from regressions while enabling backend/tracking work.

A. SNAPSHOT + SAFETY
1) Create git tag `v1-ui-freeze` on current commit and a branch `frozen-ui`.
2) Export a zip archive of the repo named `au-v1-ui-freeze.zip` in project root.
3) Add a CODEOWNERS file that requires PR review for any changes under:
   - /client/src/pages/**
   - /client/src/components/**
   - /client/src/index.css
   - /public/**
(If Replit doesn’t enforce CODEOWNERS, still create it for clarity.)

B. READ-ONLY GUARDRAILS
4) Create `.guardrails.json` with this policy:
   - forbiddenGlobs: ["client/src/pages/**","client/src/components/**","client/src/index.css","public/**"]
   - allowedEditors: ["*.md","server/**","lib/**","client/src/lib/**","client/src/analytics/**"]
5) Add a `scripts/precommit-guard.mjs` that blocks commits touching forbiddenGlobs unless `ALLOW_UI_CHANGES=true` is set.
6) Install and configure `husky` + `lint-staged` to run `node scripts/precommit-guard.mjs` on each commit.

C. SMOKE TESTS (no styling changes)
7) Add a minimal Vitest/React Testing Library setup:
   - tests that render the following routes without errors: "/", "/early-access", "/host-application", "/thank-you"
   - test clicks on primary CTAs don’t throw and trigger `data-testid` events.
   Name file `client/src/__tests__/smoke.test.tsx`.
8) Add `npm run test:smoke` to run only these tests.

D. BUILD + HEALTH CHECKS
9) Add `npm run check:build` that:
   - builds the app
   - prints bundle sizes (top 10 modules)
   - fails if build size grows >10% vs a saved baseline `build-baseline.json`.
   On first run, save current sizes as the baseline.
10) Add `npm run check:ui` that runs both `test:smoke` and `check:build`.

E. ENV + MODES
11) Ensure `.env`, `.env.staging`, `.env.production` exist (keep values blank). NEVER hardcode secrets.
12) Add `README-LOCK.md` that explains how to temporarily allow UI edits:
    - set `ALLOW_UI_CHANGES=true` in env, run `npm run unlock-ui` (a script that just echoes a warning).
    - after edits, update `build-baseline.json` with `npm run baseline` (separate script).
    - commit with message starting `UI-EDIT:` (precommit checks require this prefix when ALLOW_UI_CHANGES=true).

F. OUTPUT
13) Print a single consolidated diff of files created/changed.
14) Print commands to:
    - run smoke checks: `npm run check:ui`
    - create a new branch for backend work: `git checkout -b backend-phase-1`
15) Confirm the location of `au-v1-ui-freeze.zip`.

ALLOWED NEW DEV DEPENDENCIES ONLY:
- vitest, @testing-library/react, @testing-library/jest-dom, husky, lint-staged, picocolors

Do not modify component code, CSS, or assets. If any step requires touching frozen files, STOP and ask.
