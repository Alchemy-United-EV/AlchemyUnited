STRICT MODE — Do NOT add packages, create new files, or refactor routes. Only modify the real Host Application page file and (optionally) index.css. Keep changes minimal and reversible.

Target page: /host-application

Objectives (mobile first):
1) Content must appear without extra scrolling when visiting /host-application (no blank space above the header).
2) The "Submit Host Application" button must be highly prominent (gold gradient, large touch target, boxed wrapper, reassurance text).
3) Do not affect any other routes, forms, analytics, or API handlers.

A) Identify the ACTUAL component rendered at /host-application
   - Search the repo for (case-insensitive): "host-application", "HostApplication", "Submit Host Application", "<form"
   - List all candidate files with full paths.
   - OPEN the top candidate and paste the first 50 lines and the export line to show the component name.
   - Prove the router import for path "/host-application" by showing the import line from App.tsx (or router file) and the matched component path.

B) Snapshot before edits:
   - Print the current main title text (h1) and the current submit button text exactly as in the DOM.

C) Make ONLY these focused edits in the confirmed Host Application file:
   1. Section spacing (remove initial scroll gap)
      - Ensure the outermost section/container includes: className="pt-8 sm:pt-16 mx-auto max-w-2xl px-4"
      - Remove or reduce any "pt-24", "pt-28", "pt-32", "mt-28/32" found at the top of this page to "pt-8" or none.
      - Decorative/logo elements ABOVE the title should be "hidden sm:block" (mobile hides it) or constrained with "max-h-20".
   2. Title + description rhythm
      - h1: className="text-3xl sm:text-4xl font-extrabold tracking-tight text-neutral-900"
      - helper/intro paragraph under h1: className="mt-3 text-base sm:text-lg text-neutral-700"
   3. Premium CTA wrap for the submit button (keep type='submit')
      - Wrap the submit button in this container placed directly below the form fields (or at the form’s end):
        <div className="mt-6 rounded-2xl p-3 bg-white/70 border border-[#D4AF37]/40 shadow-[0_8px_28px_rgba(0,0,0,0.08)]">
          <button type="submit"
            className="w-full rounded-xl px-5 py-3.5 font-semibold text-black
                       bg-[linear-gradient(180deg,#F5D36B_0%,#D4AF37_60%,#B89022_100%)]
                       shadow-[0_10px_26px_rgba(212,175,55,.45)]
                       transition-transform duration-150 hover:-translate-y-0.5">
            Submit Host Application
          </button>
          <p className="mt-2 text-xs text-neutral-600 text-center">
            Your information is secure. We reply within 2–3 business days.
          </p>
        </div>
   4. Inputs/areas (optional style-only adjustments, no logic change):
      - Each field group: "mt-4"
      - Inputs/textareas ensure: "rounded-xl border-neutral-300 focus:border-[#D4AF37] focus:ring-[#D4AF37]/30"

D) OPTIONAL (only if file exists) — append to END of client/src/index.css (do not create files):
/* host-application mobile polish */
.ha-card { background: radial-gradient(800px 200px at 50% 0, rgba(212,175,55,.08), transparent 60%) #fff; }

E) Show the exact UNIFIED DIFF for every file you modified and also print the first 25 lines of the Host Application component AFTER edits so I can verify spacing classes.

F) Verification checklist (report results explicitly):
   - Router path "/host-application" → component file path == the file you edited (print both paths).
   - No "pt-24/pt-28/pt-32/mt-32" remain at the top of this component.
   - The submit button now has the gold gradient classes and is wrapped in the rounded box container with reassurance text.
   - Outer wrapper includes "pt-8 sm:pt-16 mx-auto max-w-2xl px-4".
   - On a 390×844 viewport the page shows content without scrolling and the CTA is fully visible.

Do NOT modify other pages, components, APIs, or analytics. If the host file isn’t found, STOP and show the router mapping + nearest match; make no changes until confirmed.
