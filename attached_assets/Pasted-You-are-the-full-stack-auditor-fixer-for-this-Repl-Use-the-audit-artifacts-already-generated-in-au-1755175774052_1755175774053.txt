You are the full-stack auditor/fixer for this Repl. Use the audit artifacts already generated in /audit to implement only the highest-ROI, non-breaking improvements.

SCOPE
- Cover pages, buttons/CTAs, forms/APIs, SEO, accessibility, and analytics.
- Do NOT alter visual design, layout, or copy tone. Keep the current hero, cards, and theme intact.

INPUTS
- Read: /audit/summary.md, /audit/pages-audit.md, /audit/cta-audit.md, /audit/forms-report.md, /audit/seo-report.md, /audit/a11y-report.json, /audit/a11y-fixes.md, /audit/tracking-plan.md, /audit/fix-priorities.csv

IMPLEMENT THESE FIXES (in this order)
1) SEO quick wins (sitewide)
   - Add unique, descriptive <title> and <meta name="description"> for every route listed in pages-audit.md.
   - Ensure <html lang="en"> (or correct language) on every page shell.
   - Add <link rel="canonical"> to index.html and any other routable HTML entry points.
   - Generate public/robots.txt and a minimal public/sitemap.xml that lists all routes.
   - Add Organization + WebSite JSON-LD to the home page using /audit/seo-report.md guidance.

2) Accessibility (WCAG) fixes (no styling changes)
   - Apply the exact aria-label / role / id associations from /audit/a11y-fixes.md.
   - Ensure form <label for> bindings are correct; add aria-describedby for helper/error text.
   - Make all buttons real <button type="button|submit"> and all links real <a>.
   - Add “Skip to main content” link and target id="main" on the main content container.

3) CTA tracking & analytics (per /audit/tracking-plan.md)
   - Add data-cta attributes to all primary/secondary CTAs exactly as specified.
   - Wire the existing /api/analytics/log endpoint to send a POST on each CTA click with {ctaId, page, ts}.
   - Guard failures (non-blocking) and ensure no console errors.

4) Performance hygiene (safe wins only)
   - Defer any non-critical scripts; preload critical font(s) if applicable.
   - Ensure images have width/height and loading="lazy" when below the fold.

VALIDATION (automate and attach results to /audit/after/)
- Run Playwright/axe/lighthouse or the existing scripts used in the previous audit.
- Re-run button and page route checks; confirm 0 console errors.
- Re-test both form endpoints; expect 201 with <100ms local response.
- Export: 
  - /audit/after/seo-score.txt (new score + diffs)
  - /audit/after/a11y-report.json (axe) + a11y-summary.md
  - /audit/after/pages-audit.md and cta-audit.md (updated)
  - /audit/after/forms-report.md (latency + status)
  - /audit/after/change-log.md (file-by-file changes, before→after)
  - /audit/after/roi-proof.md (what fixes shipped, estimated lift based on fix-priorities.csv)

GUARDRAILS
- No visual layout changes, spacing shifts, or copy rewrites.
- Do not remove existing components or animations.
- If a fix would change design, skip it and note it in /audit/after/change-log.md under “Deferred (design-impact).”

SUCCESS CRITERIA
- All 6+ CTAs tracked (data-cta present) and still navigate correctly.
- Forms still return 201; no console errors anywhere.
- SEO checks: unique titles/descriptions; canonical present; robots.txt + sitemap.xml created; JSON-LD valid.
- A11y: all issues listed in /audit/a11y-report.json are resolved or documented as “Deferred”.
- Provide a final executive summary at /audit/after/summary.md with checkboxes for each criterion and next 3 recommended steps.

When finished, post a short summary with: new SEO score, number of a11y issues fixed, CTA tracking status, and links to the /audit/after/* files.
