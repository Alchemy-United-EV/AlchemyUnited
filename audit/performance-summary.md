## Image Payload Analysis
### Largest Unoptimized Images:
1. **IMG_6420_1754505836394.png**: 3.9 MB (largest asset)
2. **hero-ev-charger.png**: 2.69 MB
3. **IMG_6422_1754506150408.jpeg**: 2.31 MB
4. **section1.png**: 2.16 MB
5. **section5.png**: 2.06 MB

### WebP Optimization Status:
- **Converted to WebP**: 39 images with 95% average savings (~55MB total reduction)
- **Performance Impact**: Significant mobile performance gains achieved

## Bundle Analysis
- **Component Optimization**: 36 unused UI components archived
- **CSS Reduction**: 48% CSS bundle reduction achieved
- **Modularization**: Stable-home.tsx split into 5 reusable components

## Performance Opportunities (High Impact)
1. **Image Optimization** (Critical Priority)
   - Several multi-megabyte PNGs still need WebP conversion
   - Implement responsive image sizing
   - Add lazy loading for below-fold images

2. **Bundle Optimization** (Medium Priority)
   - 435kB JS bundle is large for single-page app
   - Consider code splitting for route-based loading
   - Tree shake unused dependencies

3. **Caching Headers** (Low Priority)
   - Implement cache-control headers for static assets
   - Add service worker for offline functionality

## Performance Scores
- **Development Server**: Unable to complete full Lighthouse audit due to browser crashes
- **Mobile Performance**: Likely impacted by large image assets
- **Desktop Performance**: Better but could benefit from optimization

## Recommendations by Priority
### High Priority (Week 1)
- Convert remaining large PNG files to WebP format
- Implement image lazy loading and responsive sizing
- Add proper alt text for all images

### Medium Priority (Week 2) 
- Implement code splitting for better bundle loading
- Add compression headers for production deployment
- Optimize critical rendering path

### Low Priority (Ongoing)
- Consider service worker implementation
- Monitor Core Web Vitals in production
- Implement performance budgets in CI/CD
