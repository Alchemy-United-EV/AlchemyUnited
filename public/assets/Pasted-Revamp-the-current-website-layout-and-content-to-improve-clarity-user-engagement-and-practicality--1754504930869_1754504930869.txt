Revamp the current website layout and content to improve clarity, user engagement, and practicality — while keeping the luxury electric vibe.

Here’s what to implement, section-by-section:

---

✅ HERO SECTION  
• Background: Reveal more of the hero background image by reducing the black overlay to 40% opacity.  
• Headline: “Smart. Stylish. Built for EV Life.”  
• Subheadline: “Alchemy United delivers high-performance EV chargers that double as modern art.”  
• Add 3 small feature tags under subheadline: “⚡ Fast Charging · 🖤 Matte Black Finish · 🏡 Home & Business Ready”  
• Keep central alignment and gold + white font styles.

---

✅ SECTION 1 — FEATURE GRID  
• Replace “Where Art Meets Energy” with a 4-column feature grid.  
• Title: “Features That Matter” (centered, gold + bold)  
• 4 Columns (use icons above each label):
  - ⚡ Speed → “90% charge in 30 minutes”  
  - 🔒 Security → “Anti-tamper lock & weatherproof”  
  - 🎨 Design → “Matte black with gold logo”  
  - 📱 Smart App → “Remote start, tracking, and usage insights”  
• Stack into 2x2 grid on mobile.

---

✅ SECTION 2 — RESERVE / CTA  
• Headline: “Be the First to Charge Differently”  
• Subheadline: “Join the early access list and unlock:”  
• Add bullet list with checkmarks:
  - ✅ 10% off launch units  
  - ✅ First shipments guaranteed  
  - ✅ Collector edition finish  
• CTA button: “Get on the List” (keep gold background, larger size, more padding)  

---

✅ NEW SECTION — “HOW IT WORKS”  
• Title: “How It Works”  
• 4 vertical steps, each with icon + short label:
  1. Join the List  
  2. Choose Your Station  
  3. We Ship to Your Door  
  4. Plug In & Track with the App  
• Use a timeline or stepper-style layout.

---

✅ NEW SECTION — “WHY ALCHEMY UNITED?”  
• Side-by-side layout  
• Left side: image of charger on clean background (can reuse assets folder image)  
• Right side:
  - Title: “Why Alchemy United?”  
  - 3 checkmark bullet points:
    - ✅ Built for Home & Business  
    - ✅ Luxury Style, Durable Performance  
    - ✅ Easy Setup, Expert Support

---

✅ GLOBAL STYLING FIXES  
• Reduce vertical white space between all sections by 25%  
• Increase all heading font sizes by 20% for desktop view  
• Add top padding so first section doesn’t overlap on mobile  
• Use `scroll-behavior: smooth;` to enhance section transitions  
• Ensure consistent section width padding on all devices
